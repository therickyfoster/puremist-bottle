## Overview

**PureMist Bottle™** is a **self-sustaining hydration system** that **collects moisture from the air**, sterilizes it, and delivers safe drinking water anywhere.  

By combining a **passive condensation mesh**, **biochar-mycological filter cartridge**, and a **solar-rechargeable UV-C sterilization cap**, it provides **clean water in any environment** — without relying on external water sources or constant refills.

---

## Core Features

- **Atmospheric Water Capture** – Harvests **200–300 mL/day** in average humidity, even more in humid regions.  
- **UV-C Sterilization Cap** – Solar-rechargeable, ensures water is pathogen-free.  
- **Triple-Layer Filtration** – Activated carbon, biochar, and mycelium layers remove contaminants.  
- **Portable & Durable** – Lightweight (under 1 lb) and rugged for field use.  
- **Zero Disposable Filters** – Long-lasting cartridges are **reusable and compostable**.

---

## How It Works

1. **Condensation Mesh** – Specialized hydrophilic mesh collects water vapor as the bottle is exposed to air.  
2. **Gravity-Driven Filtration** – Captured moisture passes through **biochar and mycelium-based filters** to remove toxins and particulates.  
3. **UV-C Sterilization** – A solar-powered cap neutralizes microbes, ensuring potable water.  
4. **Ready to Drink** – Fresh, clean water without pumps or chemical treatments.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Recycled plastics for bottle body.  
  - Hydrophilic condensation mesh.  
  - UV-C sterilization module with flexible solar panel.  
  - Biochar and mycelium for filters.

- **Production**:  
  - Built using **existing water bottle and filtration assembly lines**.  
  - Production cost: **$20–$35 per unit**.  
  - Retail price: **$60–$120 per unit**, with optional filter refill kits.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Distributed via **outdoor gear retailers, travel suppliers, and online DTC stores**.  
  - Humanitarian editions can be **mass-deployed through NGOs and relief programs**.

---

## Use Cases

- **Hiking & Camping** – Reliable hydration without extra water weight.  
- **Travel & Survival Kits** – Clean water anywhere in the world.  
- **Emergency Preparedness** – Lifesaving tool in disasters or infrastructure failures.  
- **Urban Air + Water Purification** – Provides safe drinking water in polluted cities.

---

## Environmental Impact

- Reduces reliance on **plastic water bottles** (saves ~300–500 bottles/year per user).  
- **Zero power draw** aside from a **solar-rechargeable cap**.  
- Biochar-mycological filters are **fully compostable and carbon-negative**.  
- Helps reduce strain on **groundwater and bottled water supply chains**.

## Market Strategy

- **Target Consumers**: Outdoor enthusiasts, travelers, survivalists, and eco-conscious urban dwellers.  
- **Sales Channels**:  
  - Outdoor gear stores and camping retailers.  
  - Online DTC campaigns (Kickstarter, Amazon, Shopify).  
  - NGO and government contracts for emergency distribution.

- **Selling Points**:  
  - **Generates its own water + sterilizes it** — no need for bulky filters or bottled water.  
  - **Solar-powered and sustainable**, with reusable, compostable parts.  
  - Appeals to both **adventurers and urban health markets**.

Projected **profit margin**: 50–65%, with recurring revenue from **filter cartridge and replacement cap sales**.

---

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (2025 Q3)**  
- Finalize **condensation efficiency testing** and cap sterilization lifespan.  
- Begin **pilot production runs** for outdoor and humanitarian markets.

**Phase 2 (2025 Q4)**  
- Launch via **Kickstarter and outdoor gear distributors**.  
- Scale manufacturing with **local assembly hubs in humid climates**.

**Phase 3 (2026)**  
- Develop **community-scale atmospheric water harvesters** using same tech.  
- Integrate **IoT tracking for water quality and usage**.
